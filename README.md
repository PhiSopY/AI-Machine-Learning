# AI-Machine-Learning
* Machine Learning here refers specifically to traditional machine learning algorithm(not including Deep Learning)
* Use Jupyter Notebook to study Machine Learning.
* As for each Algorithm, algorithm principle and code will be put together in a Jupyter Notebook in [src](https://github.com/PhiSopY/AI-Machine-Learning/tree/master/src) file.
* Data used in Code will be put in [data](https://github.com/PhiSopY/AI-Machine-Learning/tree/master/data) file.
* Operation results will be put in [results](https://github.com/PhiSopY/AI-Machine-Learning/tree/master/results) file.
